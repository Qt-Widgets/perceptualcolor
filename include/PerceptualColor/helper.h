     * we have to search for the gamut boundary, because LittleCMS does not
     * provide a build-in function for this. When searching the nearest
     * in-gamut color for a given out-of-gamut color, the algorithm goes
     * step by step. Each step has the size gamutMeshSize. Once the first
     * in-gamut color is found, the algorithm refines more the precision between
     * the first in-gamut color and the last out-of-gamut color up to
     * gamutPrecision(), so gamutPrecision() has to be smaller than
     * gamutMeshSize().
     * 
     * This approach is taken because the gamut might be discontinous, so
     * a simple approach that just with each step takes the double or the
     * half of the distance, might miss some smaller patches of a discontinous
     * gamut. With gamutMeshSize() at least we can control the precision.
     * 
     * In short: Smaller values mean better precision and slower processing.

     * be smaller than âˆš((âˆ’170)Â²Â +Â 150Â²)Â â‰ˆÂ 227 and will effectively be even
     * smaller.
     * 
     * For chroma, a default value of @c 0 might be a good choise because it is less likely to make 
     * out-of-gamut problems as it is really quite in the middle of the three-dimensional gamut body.
     * And it results in an achromatic, neutral color.
     * 
     * Depending on your use case, a versatile alternative might be @c 29 which is the highest chroma
     * that is just within sRGB gamut for a Lightness of @50 on all possible hues.
     * 
     * In sRGB, the maximum chroma value (as practically observed - I have no
     * mathematics to proof that) is 132.
     * 
     * For the lightness, a default value of @c 50 seems a good choise as it is half
     * the way in the defined lightness range <tt>0..100</tt>, and it also approximates the lightness
     * that offers the most highest possible chroma at different hues. This is less likely to make
     * out-of-gamut problems as it is really quite in the middle of the three-dimensional gamut body.
     * 
     * For hue, a default value of @c 0 can be used by convention.
